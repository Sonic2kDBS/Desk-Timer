# Desk-Timer
 A timer for the desktop.
 
# Description
 Desk-Timer is a simple timer for the daily usage on the desktop.

# Main Goal
 The main goal is to have a simple and easy to use timer, that provides nothing more than what it should do, while looking simple, cleaned up and neat.

# How to compile
 You need Python 3 installed. Open a commandline and navigate to the Desk-Timer folder. There you can use the following commands:
 
 pip install pyinstaller
 pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --icon "./S2k_Coffee_2017.ico" --collect-all "customtkinter"  "./Desk-Timer1.11.py"
 
 Under ./dist/ you will find the compiled exe file. Copy it to a place, where it can stay.
 
# What about Linux?
  It may also work on Linux.

# What else?
 Currently it is in beta state. It works, but there are some things to do.
 The icon is made by myself. It is not part of the Licence but you may use it for this program.
